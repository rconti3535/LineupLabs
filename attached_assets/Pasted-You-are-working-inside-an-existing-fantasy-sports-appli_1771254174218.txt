You are working inside an existing fantasy sports application.

Before writing any code, first analyze the current implementation for:

How Roto scoring is stored in the database

How the League model stores scoring settings

How standings are calculated

Whether a matchup system already exists

How league creation and league settings forms are structured

Do not assume variable names. Use existing patterns.

Current behavior:

Only Roto scoring exists.

Roto works correctly.

League creation allows selecting scoring format (currently only Roto).

League settings allows editing scoring format (currently only Roto).

Goal:
Add support for additional scoring formats without breaking Roto:

Head to Head Points

Head to Head Each Category

Head to Head Most Categories

Season Points

High-level requirements:

League Storage
Allow leagues to store which scoring format they use.
Default existing leagues to Roto.
Do not break existing leagues.

Standings Logic
Standings should change dynamically depending on scoring format.

Head to Head Points:

Weekly matchups

Winner determined by total fantasy points

Standings track wins, losses, ties, points for, points against

Head to Head Each Category:

Weekly matchup

Compare each scoring category individually

Standings track category wins, losses, ties

Head to Head Most Categories:

Weekly matchup

Team that wins more categories gets 1 win

Standings track wins, losses, ties only

Season Points:

No weekly matchups

Rank by total cumulative fantasy points

UI
Update league creation and league settings to allow selecting the new scoring formats.
Standings page should automatically adapt columns based on format.
Do not redesign UI unnecessarily.

Architecture
Do not refactor unrelated code.
Do not rewrite Roto logic.
Extend the current scoring system in a modular way consistent with existing structure.

Before implementing:
Briefly explain:

Where scoring format is stored

How standings are currently calculated

What minimal changes are required

Then implement incrementally.
