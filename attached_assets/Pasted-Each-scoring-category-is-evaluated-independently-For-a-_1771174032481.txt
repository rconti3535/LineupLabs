Each scoring category is evaluated independently. For a given category, every team’s cumulative season statistic is calculated. Teams are then ranked from best to worst within that category. “Best” is defined by the category’s direction setting. Some categories reward higher values, such as counting stats. Others reward lower values, such as rate stats where lower indicates better performance. Each category must explicitly define whether higher or lower values rank first.

After ranking teams within a category, points are assigned based on positional order. If a league has N teams, first place in a category receives N points, second place receives N-1 points, continuing down to last place receiving 1 point. The number of points available in a category is therefore directly determined by the number of teams in the league and must update automatically if league size changes.

If two or more teams are tied within a category, the system must average the points for the tied positions and assign the same averaged value to each tied team. Ties affect only that specific category and do not alter the total number of points distributed across the league for that category.

Team totals for each category must be calculated from aggregated underlying statistics, not by averaging individual player-level rates. For ratio categories such as batting average, ERA, or WHIP, the correct approach is to sum the relevant underlying components across all players on the team roster and compute the ratio from those cumulative totals. Ratio categories must define both a numerator and denominator formula so they can be recomputed consistently as player statistics update.

Each team’s total roto score is the sum of its points across all active scoring categories. League standings are determined by sorting teams by total roto score in descending order. Because roto scoring is relative, any statistical change by one team can potentially affect the ranking and points of all other teams in that category, so recalculation must consider the entire league.

The scoring engine should therefore be designed to operate generically using a league configuration object that defines the number of teams and a list of scoring categories. Each category should define a unique identifier, ranking direction (ascending or descending), whether it is a counting stat or ratio stat, and if ratio-based, the formula components required to compute it from cumulative team data. The ranking and point assignment logic must iterate over whatever categories are active rather than assuming a fixed structure.

The system must also support commissioner edits. If the commissioner changes the number of teams, the maximum points per category automatically changes. If the commissioner adds or removes a category, the total possible roto points change accordingly. Standings must be recalculated whenever scoring rules are modified to ensure totals reflect the current league configuration.

Roto scoring is therefore a dynamic, league-relative ranking system driven entirely by configurable categories and team count, where teams earn positional points within each category and final standings are determined by summing those positional scores across all active categories.
